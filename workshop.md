# Workshop on Evolutionary Computing and Explainable AI
## Description

Description of the ECXAI workshop here in full detail

Call for paper details here

From an application perspective, important questions have arisen, for which XAI may be crucial: Is the system biased? Has the problem been formulated correctly? Is the solution trustworthy and fair? The goal of XAI and related research is to develop methods to interrogate AI processes with the aim of answering these questions. This can support decision makers while also building trust in AI decision-support through more readily understandable explanations.
We seek contributions on a range of topics related to this theme, including but not limited to:
- Interpretability vs explainability in EC and their quantification
- Landscape analysis and XAI
- Contributions of EC to XAI in general
- Use of EC to generate explainable/interpretable models
- XAI in real-world applications of EC
- Possible interplay between XAI and EC theory
- Applications of existing XAI methods to EC
- Novel XAI methods for EC
- Legal and ethical considerations
- Case studies / applications of EC & XAI technologies
